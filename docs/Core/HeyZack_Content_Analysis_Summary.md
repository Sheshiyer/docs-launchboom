## Brand Voice Guidelines

HeyZack's brand voice is that of a **tech-savvy friend** who understands smart home technology and wants to help others experience its benefits without complexity. All communications should:

1. Be conversational and approachable
2. Focus on solutions to common smart home frustrations
3. Show empathy and understanding of user pain points
4. Convey genuine enthusiasm without hype
5. Use clear language that avoids unnecessary jargon

Communications should address four key emotional drivers:
- **Relief** from smart home complexity
- **Pride** in having a truly intelligent home
- **Peace of mind** about security and energy usage
- **Excitement** about being at the forefront of AI-powered living

### 4. Research Documents

The `/docs/Research/` directory contains background research and strategic documents:

- Competitive analysis
- Benefit frameworks
- Risk assessment
- VIP pricing information
- Brand strategy documents

### 5. Archived Documents

The `/docs/Archive/` directory contains deprecated files that have been replaced by the standardized documents. These files should not be used for reference or updated.

## Implementation Plan

A detailed implementation plan has been created in [HeyZack_Implementation_Plan.md](/docs/Core/HeyZack_Implementation_Plan.md) that outlines the following phases:

1. **Review & Approve Core Documents** - Validate all standardized information
2. **Update Campaign Assets** - Ensure consistency across all marketing materials
3. **Remove or Archive Duplicate Files** - Completed with files moved to `/docs/Archive/`
4. **Create Visual Style Guide** - To complement the written brand guidelines

The implementation plan includes detailed processes, success criteria, roles and responsibilities, and metrics for measuring success.

This reorganization provides a solid foundation for the HeyZack campaign, ensuring consistent and accurate information across all marketing materials. The new folder structure makes it clear which documents serve as the definitive source of truth and which are derived from these master documents.
