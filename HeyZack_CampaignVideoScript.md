Ever feel like your smart home isn’t actually that smart?

Or that you're juggling 5 apps just to turn off a light?

## 🧠 Introduce the Problem + Hero

So have we.

Living with disconnected devices and constant micromanagement isn’t peace of mind—it’s digital chaos.

Meet Joe.

Joe’s a smart home geek and the founder of HeyZack.

He’s helped hundreds of renters and homeowners set up automation systems—and realized they all shared the same frustrations.

## 😤 Double Down on the Problem

They bought smart bulbs, cameras, voice assistants…

But the devices didn’t talk to each other.

Routines had to be manually set.

And energy bills? Still high.
