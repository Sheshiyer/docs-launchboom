## 📉 Risks & Challenges

We’ve built and tested functional prototypes, and partnered with vetted contract manufacturers. That said, like any hardware project, we face a few challenges:

### ⚙️ Component Delays
Some smart modules use chipsets or wireless bridges that are in high demand. We’ve locked in initial batches but will adapt designs if delays occur.

### 📦 Fulfillment Logistics
We’re using top-tier 3PL and Easyship for coordination, but customs delays or regional issues may arise. We'll keep you updated with shipping notices and tracking.

### 💡 Continuous Feedback Loop
We’re launching with core modules but are actively evolving based on user feedback. Backers may shape final AI scene templates and integrations.
